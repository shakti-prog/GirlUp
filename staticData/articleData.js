      "It all began when Jack Baker and James McConnell applied for a marriage license in the USA in" +

      "awareness and helped other same-sex couples come out and display their affection for each" +
      "other publicly. Later, the District of Columbia law allowed unmarried couples, irrespective of" +
      "their gender, to register as domestic partners. This marked a turning point in the US history as" +
      "Columbia was the first city to legalise same-sex couples. Even then, the US saw a continuous " +
      "ban of these marriages by its Presidents including Bill Clinton and George Bush until Barack " +
      "Obama became the first president to endorse gay marriages in 2012. Since then, people " +
      "became more open and acceptable to this and same-sex marriage was finally legalized " +
      "nationwide in 2015." +
      "Similarly, the history of many African and Asian cultures includes same-sex and transgender " +
      "marriages. But examples of formal religious ceremonies in which two men who love each other " +
      "are solemnly wedded together can be found across Europe, throughout Classical Antiquity " +
      "(between 8th century BC and 6th century AD) and until the end of the middle age. It is also " +
      "rumoured that during the Italian Renaissance (14th to 17th century), there were instances where " +
      "men were fined (and in extreme cases, burned) for living with another man “by keeping him as " +
      "his wife and in place of a wife”." +
      "Therefore, they did not tend to live together, but passionate friendships and love between men " +
      "took a lot of different forms. From Henry James and Oscar Wilde’s relationship to the passion of " +
      "David and Jonathan (of Achilles and Patroclus), countless popular ballads began writing about " +
      "gay couples." +
      "Thus it is clear that homosexual relationships in the past were not the same as they are in the" +
      "present. Although this does not imply that gay couples and the LGBTQ+ community don’t face " +
      "any hardships in the modern world." +
      "These struggles saw a number of faces in the court of law all over the world. These laws took " +
      "turns as the road took them, but there came a moment where roads had to be laid according to " +
      "what the LGBTQ+ community wanted. This paved the way for the very colourful and bright " +
      "‘Pride Parades’. Pride is an act of resistance. Pride parades’ inception was directly related to the" +
      "social and political unrests against the LGBTQ+ community. In the 1960s, raiding gay bars and " +
      "arresting the patrons in it, was a regular routine. On the 27th of June 1970, Stonewall Inn, a gay" +
      "bar at downtown, Manhattan was raided as a part of police patrolling. But this time every queer " +
      "in there stood up and fought back. This wasn’t a coloured flag hoisted, dance and music parade " +
      "though, but an ignition of the beautiful rainbow coloured flame that we see today. This flame " +
      "was kept lit by big bold pillars such as, transwomen Marsha P, Johnson’s Sylvia and Miss Major " +
      "in the first pride event in 1970, the Cristopher street liberation day march to commemorate the" +
      "agitation at the Stonewall Inn in 1965. And came into being the Pride month." +
      "Then in 1978, the first openly gay artist Gilbert Baker designed the first rainbow flag. He was " +
      "insisted by Harvey Milk, the first openly gay elected U.S. official who stated that flags are a" +
      "strong symbol of pride. Baker saw the rainbow as the sole flag of nature. So he adopted 8 " +
      "colours for the flag, each one having an inherent meaning. Hot pink for sex, red for life, orange " +
      "for healing, yellow for sunlight, green for nature, turquoise for art, indigo for harmony and violet" +
      "for spirit. These colours brought in a new psyche and energy. " +
      "The LGBTQ+ community has been within us for a long time. We knew they were there, and saw" +
      "them everyday. Some supported, some disagreed. We were really proud when we supported " +
      "THEM. The only problem is us differentiating the community. Parting them from the mainstream." +
      "Yes, surely they are not some conventional human being, but strive to become one. And that’s " +

    Title: "FORCES AGAINST SAME SEX MARRIAGES",
    Content:
      "As the world has developed over the years, globalization and technology have enabled progress in the population's mindset and beliefs. With this, people have also found freedom and societal acceptance in terms of sexual and gender orientation. People of all ages come out and explore their identities and aren't rejected in many societies. In some countries, legalization, or even displays of LGBT love is celebrated with rainbow-coloured merchandise and cheers. In other countries, it is a topic that is considered to be taboo, something which is to be frowned upon." +
      "While we have taken strides from where we once were, the LGBTQ+ community is subject to deep-rooted prejudice in the form of discrimination, intolerance, harassment, and violence even today. Some of the factors that may reinforce homophobia on a larger scale are the moral, religious, and political beliefs of a dominant group. In some countries, homosexuality is illegal and punishable by fines, imprisonment, life imprisonment, and even the death penalty. The fact that the Universal Declaration for Human Rights, drafted in 1948, does not specifically include sexual orientation allows some people to consider LGBT rights debatable. Now more and more people are openly expressing their sexual orientation, and organizing and demanding their rights. Because of the work of these groups and their allies, acceptance of LGBT rights around the world is growing, and governments in certain countries are beginning to legislate in favour of LGBT rights and anti-discrimination laws. Influential international human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch continue to run effective campaigns" +
      "But this wasn’t always the case, especially if we consider Muslim communities. In the 13th and 14th centuries, poets like Rumi and Hafiz wrote lewd verses with relative openness. In contrast, the modern Middle East has a very different stance on this topic. According to the survey taken by Pew Research Centre in 2013, most of the population thinks that homosexuals should be rejected from society: 97% in Jordan, 95% in Egypt, and 80% in Lebanon. In some countries, homosexuality is illegal and punishable by fines, imprisonment, life imprisonment and even the death penalty." +
      "Regardless of Sunni or Shia, most Muslims do have very negative attitudes toward people of LGBT. To the traditionalists, the Quran is clear about homosexuality, and there is no tolerance for debating the context or semantics. According to Mission Islam, an online network on varying Islamic teachings, every major Islamic school of thought considers sex between two men to be sinful and unlawful. Some schools of thought believe it merits severe physical punishment, including stoning to death." +
      "Others would sentence it with imprisonment or banishment from the state. Today, most governments that follow Islamic law defer on the punishment used for offenders. But there have been cases where men convicted of having gay sex have been killed. According to the International Lesbian and Gay Association, only eight predominately Muslim countries, as of 2011, retain capital punishment for homosexual behaviour: Saudi Arabia, Iran, Yemen, Qatar, Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria, and Mauritania" +
      "In Iraq, where same-sex activity is technically legal, the breakdown of order since 2003 has allowed Islamist militias and vigilantes to impose their idea of justice. Groups such as Islamic State have become notorious for gruesomely murdering people suspected of being gay by throwing them off buildings and stoning them to death" +
      "LGBT Muslims living in the United States do not typically experience this sort of physical punishment though they often face verbal persecution and social exclusion from traditional Muslim communities" +
      "Disparate sources attest to the commonality of homosexuality or homosexual practices in the Middle East in both pre-Islamic and Islamic times, the prohibition of the Quran and certain hadith against such practices, the prevalence of homoerotic themes in much of classical Arabic and Persian poetry, the extent to which the 17th, 18th and 19th-century European travellers in the Orient were impresses or shocked by its exhibiting what appeared to be a widespread, relatively public homosexual culture, and possible links between homosexuality and the origins and structure of Ottoman and Egyptian Mamluk military societies. As for more orthodox Western scholarship, history has tended to accord homosexuality an occasional and often dispositive footnote; ethnography and, more surprisingly, contemporary feminist studies treat homosexuality, if at all, dismissively - as marginal, linked to arcane initiation rituals or adolescent (hence, temporary) sexual practices in a context of sexual segregation. There are several explanations as to why ho9mosexuality is a closed subject of inquiry. The long-standing Western culture Western cultural antipathy towards homosexuality is mirrored in the Arab world by both the lack of public discourse of sexuality and a cultural taboo against homosexuality which, at present, appears to have achieved official status. Moreover, what might be described as structural myopia of predominantly heterosexual scholarship is entirely congruent with the orientalist epistemological legacy of treating texts, like the quranic prohibitions, as constitutive social realities. Social history, with its concern for the role and place in the history of minorities, ordinary people and their daily lives and perceptions, did not emerge as a corrective to traditional, political, institutional, and military history until the late 1960s" +
      "Homosexuality has indeed been commonplace, generally involving asymmetrical relations that reflect age, status, or class differences between partners and have involved variations along class lines. There is little evidence of modern homosexuality in the modern urban Middle East, although there have been reports of gay rights demonstrations in Kuwait and underground organizations in large cities such as Cairo" +
      "Sex in Islam is recognized as natural, necessary, and pleasurable, whether or not engaged in for procreative purposes. Sexual intercourse is considered lawful only when a man and woman are involved in the act which for women means that they are permitted to sexual activities only with their husbands. Sodomy between members of the same sex and Zina between men and women are strongly prohibited, and since homosexuality, more properly considered under the umbrella of sodomy by the law that prohibits homosexuality, existed in pre-Islamic times, it is mentioned in the Quran, wherein, having drawn upon the biblical story of Lot and his people, homosexuality is condemned and punishable with no concrete punishment to bear conviction. As mentioned earlier, a majority deem public humiliation through stoning as a punishment for both sodomy and adultery, while a minority advocate death sentences as repercussions for said offences. In Iran, lavat is a capital offence and has often resulted in frequent executions. Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, and Mauritania, sodomy is punishable by death. Algeria, Bahrain, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Somalia, Tunisia, and Syria hand out imprisonment sentences which could last up to 10 years. Egypt pushed homosexuality as an offence under debauchery. Although these laws may not actively seek out same-sex couples for vigorous enforcement of punishment, they nod towards the active disapproval of the fundamental right of a human being to love another human being regardless of their gender identity or sex. Such hostility often gives rise to the ruination of a person's life. Many give in to societal pressures and sign the contract to an ill-suited marriage. Some bite the bullet and decide to come out, resulting in ostracization from their families or being cast out; the worst is when the families start to seek out cures through futile conversion therapy"+
      "It is since 2002 that activism has gained the light of day through Palestinian groups such as Aswat and al-Qaws. Magazines like My Kali fight such inhumane treatment by addressing homophobia and transphobia to empower the youth to defy mainstream gender binaries in the Arab world and have been actively publishing since 2007. Social Media has contributed greatly to encouraging activism even at individual levels where advocates for the basic human rights of the LGBTQIA community speak out against irrational stigmas and dogmas" +
      "In a world of 195 countries, only 29 allow same-sex couples to access marriage rights. The 18 Middle Eastern countries are part of the 72 countries where homosexuality is illegal. The reasons behind the criminalisation of homosexuality in these countries are unknown, but, there is one reason that supports the beliefs of all those who advocate same-sex marriage: equal human rights wherein every individual enjoys the same rights as any other, regardless of their class, gender, religion, or sexual orientation, wherein an individual's welfare and happiness is above a law written on paper or religion created by man, where love has no gender or sex, where love is love.",
